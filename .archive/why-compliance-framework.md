# Why Compliance Framework?

## Change Management Issues

- **Convoluted Process:** Change management can often become unmanageable due to complexity.
- **Multiple Change Sources:** Changes may be introduced from various sources, making them harder to track and manage.
- **Frequent Changes:** Changes are frequent and often introduced by external parties.

## Compliance Monitoring Challenges

- **Snapshot Compliance:** Without a proper framework, compliance becomes just a snapshot in time and not a continuous process.
- **Compliance Drift:** There is a risk of drifting away from compliance over time.
- **Difficulty Tracking Policy Changes:** It becomes challenging to track changes in policy.

## Implementation and Automation Problems

- **Manual Compliance Marking:** It's a manual process to match compliance implementation with compliance requirements.
- **Lack of Automation:** There's an absence of automated ways to identify differences in compliance and update them accordingly.
- **Deprecation Challenges:** There's a lack of clear methods for automatic deprecation.

## Collaboration and Communication Issues

- **Collaboration Challenges:** Collaboration between the end user and the implementation departments can be difficult due to potential misinterpretation of data or context.
- **Misalignments and Inefficiencies:** These can result in wasted time, delays, incomplete information, and inaccurate assessments.

## Compliance Assurance Concerns

- **Enterprise Compliance Questions:** How to confirm, demonstrate, maintain, and automate compliance at all levels?
- **Auditor Compliance Questions:** How to control, ensure, and automate the compliance of others easily?

## Human and Systemic Errors

- **Human Error:** Compliance processes are prone to human errors.
- **Inconsistency in Current Solutions:** Current solutions for managing compliance are inconsistent.
- **Unclear Implementation Methods:** The exact methods of implementation can be unclear or inconsistent.
- **Research-Intensive Changes:** Understanding the impact of changes often requires a significant amount of research.
