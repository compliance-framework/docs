## Compliance Framework Glossary

These definitions are internal to Compliance Framework, and are here to help users onboard rather than provide a definitive final definition for the industry. Sometimes they are direct quotes from sources, sometimes made up by us, but mostly are industry terms we may come across.
If there is a dispute about the meaning of a term in an issue, then this should be the arbiter (or updated accordingly).
