# What is The Continuous Compliance Framework?

The Continuous Compliance Framework (CCF) is an open source, automated compliance testing and reporting system designed 
to help organizations continuously assess their adherence to regulatory standards such as NIST SP 800-53, SOC 2, 
PCI DSS, and GDPR. It integrates policy-based compliance checks, real-time monitoring, and structured reporting to 
streamline the traditionally manual and periodic audit processes.

CCF aims to simplify compliance challenges and promote continuous verification and collaboration within the governance, 
risk and control (GRC) community. CCF contributors are constantly engaged with the OSCAL, CNCF Compliance, and NIST 
working groups to build the future of automated compliance and reporting.
