# Argus Core

Argus Core represents the nucleus of the application, serving as the primary facilitator of core functionality and interaction within the system. It is the main driver, accommodating two critical APIs. The first API is designed to deliver comprehensive reports back to the dashboard web application, providing an insightful overview of assessments and aiding in the decision-making process. The second API is tasked with configuring the assessment runtimes, ensuring an optimal operating environment.

A key facet of Argus Core lies in its utilization of the OSCAL model. As a part of its integral operation, Argus Core translates between the Argus runtime and the OSCAL model structures.
