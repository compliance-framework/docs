# Configuration Service

The Configuration Service is responsible for managing configuration updates to the database. This includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Components, Controls, Assessments, and Attestations, as well as some involvement with AttestationJobSpecs (though it might not be responsible for creating the AttestationJobSpecs themselves).
